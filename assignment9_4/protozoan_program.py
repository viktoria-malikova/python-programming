# CS-A111 Fall 2020
# A test program for Exercise 9.4
#
# Originally written in Java by TAs in former Java course. 
# Updated and translated to python by Kerttu Pollari-Malmi
#
# The program creates Protozoan objects and tests their methods.

# The function reads a line containing integers separated by commas. The
# function creates and returns a list which contains the same integers.
